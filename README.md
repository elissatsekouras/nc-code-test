## To the reviewer

- I've tried to write my commits as a story, so reviewing the code commit by commit will give you the best overview of how this app came to be.
- The assignment stated that the text should fit the whole screen. I've opted to put a maximum width on the text container, as it looks better üíÖüèº However, by removing the `max-width` on the `.countdown-app` class you can see that my text-fitting solution works well to fill the whole screen.
- I'm using local storage to persist the event details between page reloads.

## Suggested improvements

- My interpretation of the assignment was that the text had to be resized using javascript. In a 'real life senario' I would argue that a simple css solution should do the trick. As it introduces less complexity with the same result.
- Before shipping this I would want the favicon to be updated to something cool üòä
